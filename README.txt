Mockito testing for database: This is used because the application will rely on an external database, so the tests need to use a mock object that is internally created. This allows me to test the code without testing the database that the code depends on.

Postman: Used to test the requests between the code and the database before developing the frontend component of the application.

Maven: An advantage of using maven is that it is easy to add dependancies to the application.

JUnit testing: This is used so that each method can be tested before deploying the application. This ensures that the logic in each method produces the expected outcomes.

Bootstrap: This is used as it allows for a professional presentation at the frontend.

Json: This is used because it is faster than using xml and is also easily loaded in javascript.

Map implementation: I implemented this so that the application can be used offline if needed.

Http Request: The main reason I used Http requests is because they are easier to use than angular JS or springboot.
